# stack-ticket-data-wip

This repo contains the code used to analyze data for the article [Stick It to the Ticket](https://stack.dailybruin.com/2020/01/18/ticket-data/), published on The Stack at the Daily Bruin. In this article, I worked with three others to generate the analysis and data visualizations for the article.

### Article Inspiration

### Challenges

### Code Contributions

Working code for The Stack parking ticket article. Currently unpublished, so this repo only contains analytical insights as the visualizations and articles are still in-progress.
